# Steps to run the code
Run .\aar <-parameter-> <-filename with extension-> <br>
Parameters:<br>
-e : To encode the file<br>
-d : To decode the file<br>

# Code flow in general terms
[!title]("flow of code.svg")

# Some known issues
The file extension is overwrriten(appended) when encoding the file so as to save the file extension of the original file<br>
For ex. if you compress a file with name Demo.txt it creates new file with name Demo.txt.aar<br>
Also the code only encodes single files. Going to work later on multiple files and directories.
