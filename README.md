# Steps to run the code
Run .\aar <-parameter-> <-filename with extension-> <br>
Parameters:<br>
-e : To encode the file<br>
-d : To decode the file<br>

# Code flow in general terms
[Flow of Code](./Flow of code.svg)

# Some known issues
The file extension is overwrriten(appended)<br>
For ex. if you compress a file with name Demo.txt it creates new file with name Demo.txt.aar Also when you decode this Demo.txt.aar you will get your new file with name Demo.txt.aar.txt<br>
I know it's a easy fix but I'm lazy ;)<br>
Also the code only encodes single .txt files. Going to work further on multiple files and directories
